# meeting-bingo
This is a simple bingo board app in Javascript and CSS. It's pretty simple and some of the code is ugly, but it does the job.

Deploy by copying sourcefiles into webroot, no backend required.
If you want to ease server load even more, get jquery files from CDN specified in index.html.

On the TODO-list is the following things(in no particular order):

Selecting elements from the pre-defined list to exclude from bingo board creation.

Cache busting BASH deploy script.

Validator to automatically check if the user has Bingo or not, complete with confetti rain and a message filled with sympathy for the user.
